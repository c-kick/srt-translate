## Core Rule Reminder

First line: NEVER starts with dash.
Second line: starts with "- " (dash + space).

## Quick Exchanges Merged Into Single Cues

### Question + short answer
EN: "Have you nothing better to do than stand around?" / "Look at it and tell me the truth."
NL: "Hebt u niks beters te doen? - Bekijk die Chinees en wees eerlijk."
WHY: Two speakers, one cue. First speaker's question + second speaker's demand. Clean, fast, no wasted screen time.

### Greeting + response
EN: "Thank you, Stevens." / "Mr. Lewis."
NL: "Dank je, Stevens. - Mr. Lewis."
WHY: Minimal exchange. Both speakers acknowledged in one cue. No standalone "Mr. Lewis" cue.

### Status check + reply absorbed
EN: "Thank you. That is most kind of you." / (from preceding cue) "My condolences."
NL: "Gecondoleerd. - Dank u, dat is heel vriendelijk."
WHY: Condolence and acknowledgment in one cue. "That is most kind" → "heel vriendelijk" (condensed).

### Confirm + follow-up
EN: "Yes, thank you." / "Good." / "Would you like to know what took place?"
NL: "Ja. Wilt u weten wat er gebeurd is?"
WHY: "Good" is filler — dropped. Answer and next question flow naturally.

## Dialogue Scenes With Register Contrast

### Formal exchange (Stevens + Lord Darlington)
EN: "We are well prepared, my lord." / "I'm sure you are."
NL: "We zijn erop voorbereid. - Dat geloof ik."
WHY: Both lines formal. "My lord" dropped (visual context). "I'm sure you are" → "Dat geloof ik" (I believe so — formal but concise).

### Mixed register (Lord + young guest)
EN: "Die komt nooit. - Hij heeft zojuist toegezegd."
WHY: Lord speaks casually ("Die komt nooit" — blunt). Stevens's reply is measured. Register contrast in one cue shows the relationship.

### Staff banter (informal je/jij)
EN: "Burned again?" / "Yes, I'm sorry, sir."
NL: "Alweer verbrand? - Het spijt me, meneer."
WHY: Mr. Lewis (employer) uses casual question. Staff member responds with "meneer" — formal toward employer even in informal exchange.

## Three-Way Exchanges Handled Across Cues

### Rapid three-person scene split into dual-speaker cues
EN: "It is a small mistake." / "Your father is entrusted with more than he can cope with."
NL: "Het is een klein foutje. - Uw vader kan het werk niet aan."
WHY: Two speakers, opposing views, one cue. First line is Stevens's defense; dash-line is Miss Kenton's concern. The third participant (the father) is discussed, not speaking.

### Boss + two staff members
EN: "Mr. Stevens Sr. is very good at his job..." / "I can assure you that I'm very good at mine." / "Of course." / "Thank you." / "If you will please excuse me."
NL: "Mr. Stevens senior is vast heel goed in z'n werk." / "Ik verzeker u dat ik heel goed in het mijne ben." / "Natuurlijk. - Dank u. En nu moet ik gaan."
WHY: Five EN cues → three NL. The final NL cue is dual-speaker: Stevens's "Natuurlijk" + Miss Kenton's departure in one cue.

## What NOT to Merge as Dual Speaker

### Emotional beats need separate cues
EN: "Miss Kenton, you are of very great value to this house."
NL: "Miss Kenton, u bent van grote waarde voor dit huis."
WHY: This stands alone. Stevens's rare emotional statement needs its own cue for dramatic weight. Don't merge with Miss Kenton's response.

### Long lines — keep separate
If either speaker's text exceeds ~35 characters, splitting across cues is better than creating an unbalanced dual-speaker cue. Rule of thumb: dual-speaker works when both lines are short.

### Attribution must be clear
Never create a dual-speaker cue where it's unclear who says which line. If the scene has three speakers and two could plausibly say either line, use separate cues.
