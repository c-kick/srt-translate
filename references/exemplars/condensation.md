# Exemplars: Condensation & Merging

Gold-standard EN→NL pairs demonstrating how to reduce text while preserving meaning.
Sources: The Remains of the Day (1993) — professional NL broadcast subtitles.
          The Fog of War (2003) — political interview documentary.
          Planet Earth (2006) — nature documentary.

Each entry: EN source → NL translation → WHY (the reasoning behind the choice).

## Principle: Think in Sentences, Not Cues

Multiple short EN cues often form a single thought. Merge them into fewer, more
natural NL cues. The goal is comfortable reading, not cue-count preservation.

---

## Heavy Condensation (ratio < 0.60)

### Exclamations collapsed to single Dutch word
EN: "Oh, damn it!" + "Blast!"
NL: "Verdomme."
WHY: Two English exclamations → one punchy Dutch equivalent. No information lost — the emotion is identical.

### Hedging removed, directness preserved
EN: "I simply haven't time to stand here with you, engaging in idle talk."
NL: "Ik heb geen tijd om met u te babbelen."
WHY: "Simply" and "engaging in idle talk" are verbose. Dutch directness: "babbelen" captures the dismissiveness.

### Polite padding stripped
EN: "Thank you, sir. I'm most grateful for your help."
NL: "Bedankt voor uw hulp, Sir."
WHY: "Most grateful" is redundant padding. The gratitude is already clear.

### Rhetorical question → statement
EN: "Nice little place, isn't it?"
NL: "Gezellig hier."
WHY: Tag question removed. "Gezellig" is the perfect untranslatable Dutch word — warmer than "nice".

### Status report condensed
EN: "You all right, then?" / "Yes."
NL: "Alles in orde?"
WHY: The "Yes" is implied (viewers see the nod). The question alone suffices.

### Auction numbers: words → digits
EN: "Against you, sir, at eleven and a half thousand guineas."
NL: "Meneer biedt 11.500 guinjes."
WHY: Written-out numbers waste space. Digits are faster to read. "Against you" → "biedt" is more direct.

## Merge & Condense (2+ EN cues → 1 NL cue)

### Filler dialogue removed, core preserved
EN: "Well, did you have a pleasant evening?" / "Yes, thank you." / "Good." / "Would you like to know what took place?"
NL: "Nou, was het gezellig? - Ja. Wilt u weten wat er gebeurd is?"
WHY: Three cues → one. "Good" adds nothing. "Pleasant evening" → "gezellig" (again, the perfect Dutch word). The essential question survives intact.

### Greetings + substance merged
EN: "My lord?" / "Mr. Lewis, the American, has arrived." / "He was expected tomorrow. What have you done with him?"
NL: "Mylord, Mr. Lewis is gearriveerd. - Ik verwachtte hem pas morgen."
WHY: "My lord?" as standalone cue wastes screen time. Merge into announcement. "What have you done with him?" implied by context.

### Polite preface absorbed
EN: "I really must ask you, please..." / "not to disturb the few moments I have to myself."
NL: "Wilt u m'n schaarse vrije momenten niet meer verstoren?"
WHY: The two-cue hesitant English → one direct Dutch request. "Really must ask you, please" is padding; "wilt u... niet meer" carries the same firmness.

### Repetition collapsed
EN: "I'll repeat it. 'There will be no discernible traces left..." / "of the recent occurrence by that time.'"
NL: "Er zullen geen resten van de recente gebeurtenis meer rondslingeren."
WHY: "I'll repeat it" is stage direction, not content. Cut it. One clean statement.

### Condolences streamlined
EN: "Mr. Stevens." / "My condolences." / "Thank you. That is most kind of you."
NL: "Gecondoleerd. - Dank u, dat is heel vriendelijk."
WHY: "Mr. Stevens" as vocative adds nothing (viewers see who's addressed). Three cues → one dual-speaker cue.

### Verbose instruction → direct
EN: "I'll come straight to the point." / "Do, and be done with it." / "Some of us have work to be getting on with."
NL: "Ik zal meteen ter zake komen. - Prima, er ligt nog genoeg werk."
WHY: Three cues → one. "Be done with it" and "getting on with" are paraphrases of the same impatience — one line suffices.

### Request simplified
EN: "but I do have something to convey to you rather urgently." / "If I may, I'll come to the point."
NL: "Ik moet u heel dringend iets meedelen. Ik kom meteen ter zake."
WHY: "If I may" is British politeness that Dutch doesn't need. Direct statement.

## Smart 1:1 Condensation

### Indirect → direct
EN: "I was very foolish a little while ago."
NL: "Ik liet me te veel gaan."
WHY: "Was very foolish" is self-assessment. "Liet me te veel gaan" (lost control) is more vivid and shorter.

### Easy does it
EN: "Okay. Easy does it."
NL: "Rustig maar."
WHY: "Okay" is filler. "Easy does it" = "rustig maar" — a perfect Dutch equivalent in two words.

### Verbose to crisp
EN: "What do you want me to do with them?"
NL: "Wat moet ik ermee doen?"
WHY: "Want me to do" → "moet ik... doen". Shorter, equally clear. "Ermee" replaces "with them" in one word.

### Period-appropriate formality preserved but tightened
EN: "If he deteriorates, let me know." / "I will, sir. Thank you, doctor."
NL: "Bel me als z'n toestand verslechtert."
WHY: "I will, sir. Thank you, doctor" is acknowledgment — viewers see the nod. One cue with the essential instruction.

## Monologue Condensation (extended speech)

Interview/monologue documentaries require condensing long stretches of speech while
maintaining the speaker's intellectual thread. Source: The Fog of War (2003).

### Verbose self-description → essential fact
EN: "I was the first president in the history of the company... that had ever been president other than a member of the Ford family."
NL: "Ik was de eerste president-directeur die geen familielid was."
WHY: 127 → 60 chars. "In the history of the company" and "that had ever been" are redundant elaboration. Dutch negative construction ("die geen... was") replaces the clumsy English double-negative.

### Hedging dropped without changing meaning
EN: "We're gonna run those punch cards through the IBM sorting machines... and we're gonna sort on age, education, accomplishment... grades, et cetera."
NL: "Die gaan allemaal door de IBM-sorteermachines... en we sorteren op leeftijd, opleiding, bekwaamheden enzovoort."
WHY: "We're gonna" (informal) → direct statement. "Accomplishment, grades" simplified to "bekwaamheden" (capabilities — absorbs two concepts). Lists survive; setup filler doesn't.

### Meta-commentary removed
EN: "They said, 'The major problem is packaging.' They said, 'You buy eggs and you know how eggs come in a carton?'" / "I said, 'I don't buy eggs. My wife does it.'" / "They said, 'Well, you ask her, when she puts that carton down on the drain board, do the eggs break?'"
NL: "Die zeiden: Het is de verpakking. U weet hoe eieren worden verpakt?" / "Die koopt m'n vrouw, zei ik." / "Oké, vraag haar of de eieren breken als ze de doos neerzet."
WHY: 5 cues → 3. "They said" / "I said" attribution streamlined. "On the drain board when she gets home" → "als ze de doos neerzet" (when she puts the box down — essential action only). Anecdotal humor preserved.

### Emotional restraint condensed
EN: "I've never seen him... more upset. He totally blanched."
NL: "Ik had hem nog nooit zo van streek gezien. Hij werd lijkbleek."
WHY: "Totally blanched" → "lijkbleek" (deathly pale — Dutch compound that's more vivid than "totally blanched"). "More upset" → "zo van streek" (so distraught — natural Dutch).

### "That's the way" filler pattern
EN: "That's the way it began." → NL: "Zo begon het."
EN: "That's the way it ended." → NL: "Zo eindigde het."
WHY: "That's the way" → "Zo" — consistently one word in Dutch. Pattern recognition: when this filler recurs in monologue, always → "Zo + verb."

## Narration Merge (nature documentary)

Nature documentary narration uses many short EN cues (one per phrase/clause).
Dutch merges these into flowing sentences. The text length stays similar —
it's structural merging, not condensation. Source: Planet Earth (2006).

### Three descriptive clauses → one sentence
EN: "Like the water running through it, / the ice itself is constantly moving, / flowing down the valley with unstoppable force."
NL: "De gletsjer beweegt zich als een niet te stuiten natuurkracht door de vallei."
WHY: 3 cues → 1. The three English phrases are fragments of one thought — in Dutch they become one sentence. "Niet te stuiten natuurkracht" (unstoppable natural force) absorbs both the comparison and the descriptor.

### Verbose description → one vivid verb
EN: "On these treacherous slopes / no hunter other than the snow leopard / would have a chance of catching such fragile prey."
NL: "Alleen de sneeuwluipaard kan op zulke hellingen een prooi verschalken."
WHY: 3 cues → 1 (ratio 0.62). The entire "no hunter other than... would have a chance of catching" → "Alleen... kan... verschalken." Dutch hunting verb does all the work.

### Behavioural observation merged
EN: "kangaroos manage to get through the hottest part of the day / without heat stroke."
NL: "voorkomen de kangoeroes een zonnesteek."
WHY: 2 cues → 1 (ratio 0.50). "Manage to get through the hottest part of the day without" (verbose) → "voorkomen" (prevent). One Dutch verb replaces 12 English words.

### Scientific process: three steps → one sentence
EN: "During its journey from the surface / the water absorbed carbon dioxide from the soil / making it mildly acidic."
NL: "Tijdens zijn reis neemt het CO2 op, waardoor het enigszins zuur wordt."
WHY: 3 cues → 1. "Carbon dioxide" → "CO2". The process (absorb → become acidic) joined with "waardoor" (whereby).

## What NOT to Cut (meaning-critical elements)

These elements must NEVER be condensed away:
- Negations: "I can't" vs "I can" changes everything
- Quantifiers on first mention: "300 Dutchmen" — the number matters
- Commitment verbs: "I promise" vs "I think" changes the weight
- Character names on first introduction
- Plot-critical modifiers: "secretly", "only", "never"
