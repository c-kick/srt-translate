## Narration: Formal, Measured, Vivid

Documentary narration demands complete, authoritative Dutch sentences.
The gold standard shows: tighter than EN, more vivid, never vague.

### Compound adjective replaces relative clause
EN: "Paratroopers and panzers overpowered the Dutch peacetime army, with its obsolete weapons."
NL: "Para's en tanks overmeesterden het slechtbewapende Nederlandse leger."
WHY: "Peacetime army, with its obsolete weapons" → "slechtbewapende Nederlandse leger" — the compound adjective "slechtbewapend" absorbs an entire relative clause. "Panzers" → "tanks" (natural Dutch). "Paratroopers" → "Para's" (standard Dutch abbreviation in military context).

### Abstract → concrete
EN: "Faced with the prospect of Nazi rule, more than 300 Dutchmen, mainly Jews, preferred to commit suicide."
NL: "Ruim 300 Nederlanders, vooral joden, verkozen de dood boven de nazi's."
WHY: "Preferred to commit suicide" → "verkozen de dood boven de nazi's" (chose death over the Nazis). Far more powerful: it names what they rejected, not just what they chose. "Dutchmen" → "Nederlanders" (standard Dutch, not archaic).

### Vivid Dutch idiom in narration
EN: "In 15 minutes they started fires which destroyed the city centre and struck terror into the population."
NL: "Binnen een kwartier stond 't centrum in lichterlaaie... en waren er legio slachtoffers."
WHY: "Started fires which destroyed" → "stond in lichterlaaie" (stood in bright flames — a vivid Dutch expression). "Struck terror into the population" → "waren er legio slachtoffers" (there were countless victims) — shifts from abstract emotion to concrete fact.

### Verbose English → punchy Dutch narration
EN: "Using Holland's excellent roads, Hitler's columns raced across the flat countryside before the Allies could come to the rescue."
NL: "Over de prima wegen rukte Hitlers leger snel op. Voor hulp was het te laat."
WHY: One flowing EN sentence → two punchy NL sentences. "Raced across the flat countryside" → "rukte snel op" (military verb: "advanced rapidly"). "Before the Allies could come to the rescue" → "Voor hulp was het te laat" (for help it was too late — short, dramatic, V2 inverted).

### Emotional narration through simplicity
EN: "That night, as Rotterdam blazed, the Dutch people were leaderless."
NL: "Terwijl Rotterdam brandde, zat 't volk zonder regering."
WHY: "Were leaderless" → "zat zonder regering" (sat without government). "Zat" (sat) is more evocative than "was" — a people sitting helpless. "'t volk" is poetic Dutch for "the people".

### Political language made concrete
EN: "He called for cooperation between two Germanic peoples of the same blood."
NL: "Hij pleitte voor samenwerking tussen beide volken."
WHY: "Of the same blood" dropped — the NL subtitler judged that quoting Nazi racial language in narration was unnecessary. The fact of the call for cooperation suffices. Editorial judgment within condensation.

### Cultural localization
EN: "In the Hall of Knights at The Hague, he addressed German officials."
NL: "In de Ridderzaal hield hij een toespraak..."
WHY: "Hall of Knights at The Hague" → "Ridderzaal" — Dutch viewers know what the Ridderzaal is. No explanation needed. "Addressed German officials" → "hield een toespraak" (gave a speech) — the audience is specified in the following cue.

## Interview Speech: Clean Without Sanitizing

The World At War features extensive witness testimony. The gold standard
cleans spoken-word filler while preserving the speaker's personality.

### Rambling cleaned to clarity
EN: "Maybe they were the enemy to us, but, really, true, they didn't see us an enemy at that moment at least, you see, because we were just hotel employees, and so long as we didn't bother them, they accept everything, you see."
NL: "Misschien waren zij onze vijand. Maar zij zagen ons niet als vijand, tenminste toen nog niet. Wij waren gewoon hotelpersoneel. Zolang wij hen niet dwarszaten, konden we onze gang gaan."
WHY: All fillers removed ("really, true", "you see" x2, "I mean"). Run-on speech broken into four clear sentences. But the speaker's hesitant perspective ("misschien", "tenminste") and matter-of-fact tone ("gewoon hotelpersoneel") preserved. "Dwarszaten" is natural colloquial Dutch. "Onze gang gaan" (go about our business) — Dutch idiom.

### Emotional testimony kept simple
EN: "We were completely stunned, and psychologically broken."
NL: "We waren totaal overrompeld... en psychisch kapot."
WHY: Near-literal, but "kapot" (broken/shattered) is stronger colloquial Dutch than the clinical "psychologically broken". The ellipsis marks the speaker's pause — this is testimony, not narration.

### Family memory with Dutch directness
EN: "And he said, 'Come with me. Let's try to escape.'" / "And I remember that my mother said, 'Escape? Why?'" / "'I must wait for the man who brings the laundry.'"
NL: "En hij zei: Kom mee, dan proberen we te ontsnappen." / "M'n moeder zei toen: Ontsnappen, waarom?" / "De man van de wasserij komt zo. Hoezo ontsnappen?"
WHY: "I remember that" dropped (filler). "M'n moeder" (not "mijn moeder" — matches spoken register). "Hoezo" is colloquial Dutch — more natural than literal "waarom" would be here. Direct speech without quotation marks — Dutch subtitle convention.

### NSB collaborator testimony
EN: "It was quite different, because a German has a German character and a Dutchman has a Dutch character."
NL: "Al was dit anders, want Duitsers en Nederlanders zijn niet eender."
WHY: Simplified without losing the apologist's reasoning. "Niet eender" (not the same) is more natural Dutch than a literal "have different characters".

## Military & Historical Terminology

### Standard Dutch military terms
- paratroopers → para's (abbreviation standard in NL military context)
- panzers → tanks (NOT "pantserwagens")
- peacetime army → slechtbewapend leger (context-appropriate compound)
- columns → leger (army — more natural than "colonnes")
- capitulated → capituleerde (same root, Dutch conjugation)
- surrender → zich overgeven ("gaf zich over")
- prisoners of war → krijgsgevangenen
- civil servants → ambtenaren
- Reich commissioner → rijkscommissaris
- decree → decreet

### Dutch historical terms (no translation needed for NL audience)
- Ridderzaal (not "Hall of Knights")
- Wilhelmus (Dutch national anthem)
- NSB (not "Dutch Nazi Party")
- Anschluss (kept German — historically standard)
- Lunteren (place name, no context needed)

### Number formatting in documentary narration
- "80,000" → "80.000" (Dutch thousand separator)
- "300 Dutchmen" → "300 Nederlanders" (or "Ruim 300" for "more than")
- "May 14" → "14 mei" (Dutch date format)
- "1938" → "1938" (years unchanged)
- "one percent" → "één procent" (Dutch diacritical: één)
- "15 minutes" → "een kwartier" (Dutch time expression)

## Documentary Condensation Patterns

### Narration: drop throat-clearing
EN starts: "On May 10, 1940, without a declaration of war, Germany struck against neutral Holland."
NL starts: "Op 10 mei 1940 viel Duitsland het neutrale Nederland binnen."
WHY: "Without a declaration of war" dropped. The fact of invasion implies this. Documentary narration: every word must earn its place.

### Occupation description tightened
EN: "Germany imposed a new administration headed by a Reich commissioner personally responsible to Hitler and empowered to rule by decree."
NL: "Duitsland installeerde een regering onder een rijkscommissaris... die mocht regeren bij decreet."
WHY: "Personally responsible to Hitler" dropped — context makes this obvious. "Imposed a new administration" → "installeerde een regering" (more concrete verb). "Empowered to rule" → "mocht regeren" (was permitted to rule — Dutch directness).

### Hope and uncertainty
EN: "The Germans promised to maintain living standards and to cure unemployment." / "The occupation might not be so bad after all."
NL: "De Duitsers beloofden dat de werkloosheid zou verdwijnen." / "Misschien viel die bezetting wel mee."
WHY: "Maintain living standards" condensed away — "cure unemployment" is the more concrete promise. "Might not be so bad" → "viel wel mee" — a quintessentially Dutch expression meaning "turned out not so bad". Understated, period-appropriate.

---

## Formal Register in Documentary

### Narration uses complete, measured sentences
- Never fragments or trailing thoughts
- Prefer active voice: "Duitsland installeerde" over "Er werd geïnstalleerd"
- Use "het" + noun constructions for authority: "het land", "'t volk", "de bevolking"
- Abbreviations acceptable in military context: "para's", "dr."
- "'t" acceptable in narration for rhythm: "'t centrum", "'t land", "'t volk"

### Interview segments use speaker's natural register
- Informal: "m'n", "z'n", "gewoon", "kapot"
- Don't elevate — a hotel worker speaks like a hotel worker
- Don't dumb down — an academic speaks formally
- Preserve hesitation markers where meaningful: "..." for genuine pause
- Remove filler unconditionally: "you see", "I mean", "sort of"

## Modern Documentary: Fast-Paced Interview Style
Source: Milli Vanilli (2023) — contemporary music documentary with rapid interviews.

### Song lyrics stripped, speech preserved
EN: "He basically brushed it off and said," / "'You know, yeah, they didn't sing...'" / "♪ I just don't know what I should do ♪"
NL: "Hij wuifde het weg, met: 'Ja, ze zongen niet zelf.'"
WHY: Song lyric cue (♪) dropped entirely. "Basically" (filler) dropped. "You know" dropped. Core quote preserved with natural Dutch: "wuifde het weg" (waved it away — vivid Dutch).

### Repetitive emphasis → single statement
EN: "Yeah, I understand-- I really understand them." / "I have to say I understand them."
NL: "Ik snap het wel. Ik begrijp ze."
WHY: Three variations of "I understand" → two. "Snap" (informal) + "begrijp" (formal) creates natural emphasis without repetition.

### Stuttered speech cleaned
EN: "But I felt like there was something inside of him that was--that was missing."
NL: "Maar, ik wist dat hij iets miste."
WHY: Stutter removed. "Felt like there was something inside of him" → "wist dat hij iets miste" (knew he was missing something). Dutch directness.

### Slang adapted to Dutch equivalent
EN: "He was like a big player."
NL: "Echt een hotshot."
WHY: "Big player" → "hotshot" — colloquial English term that Dutch has adopted. More punchy than "grote speler". "He was like" filler dropped.

### Verbose explanation → one punchy sentence
EN: "That's why he had us, to handle people like Milli Vanilli."
NL: "Wij moesten Milli Vanilli temmen."
WHY: Entire setup ("that's why he had us") dropped. "Handle people like" → "temmen" (tame — more vivid, one word). The meaning is clearer in fewer words.

### Informal question simplified
EN: "'Why didn't anybody from the label speak out,' is that what you're asking me?"
NL: "Vraag je me waarom het label zweeg?"
WHY: The meta-commentary ("is that what you're asking me") absorbed into a direct reformulation. "Speak out" → "zweeg" (was silent — reversed framing, more Dutch).

### Filler + false starts → clean sentence
EN: "Well, the past six years, I was in Los Angeles undercover, you know, doing my thing."
NL: "In L.A., als normale burger."
WHY: "Well" cut. "The past six years" answered in preceding Q (not repeated). "Undercover doing my thing" → "als normale burger" (as a regular citizen — Dutch understatement). "L.A." instead of "Los Angeles" — natural for informal speech.

### Music industry terminology
- lip-sync → doen alsof (pretend — Dutch euphemism for the deception)
- class action lawsuits → rechtszaken (simplified — Dutch viewers don't need the legal specificity)
- Recording Academy → 'Recording Academy' (kept English — industry name)
- debut album → debuutalbum (Dutch compound)
- audience → fans / publiek (context-dependent)
- the label → het label (Dutch adoption of English term)

### Cultural adaptation in modern documentary
- "Thrown under the bus" → "liet vallen" (let fall — Dutch idiom for betrayal)
- "To top it all off" → "Als toetje" (as dessert — playful Dutch equivalent)
- "The picture fits" → "Het plaatje klopte" (the picture was right — Dutch expression)
- "I was doing my thing" → "als normale burger" (normal citizen — cultural adaptation)
- "He's sometimes just wandering" → "soms de weg kwijt" (sometimes lost — Dutch expression)

## Nature Documentary: Poetic Narration
Source: Planet Earth (2006) — nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough.

Nature documentary narration is measured, poetic prose. The Dutch gold standard
doesn't just translate — it often elevates, choosing more vivid or evocative Dutch
over literal English. Merging is structural (2-3 short EN cues → 1 flowing NL cue)
rather than condensation-driven.

### Vivid Dutch replaces neutral English
EN: "This is a frozen alien world."
NL: "Wij horen niet thuis in deze wereld van ijs."
WHY: "Frozen alien world" → "wereld van ijs" (world of ice) + "Wij horen niet thuis" (we don't belong here). The NL is longer but far more evocative — it places the viewer in the scene.

### "Visitors" → "gedoogd" (tolerated)
EN: "Some might think that by climbing a great mountain they have somehow conquered it, but we can only be visitors here."
NL: "We denken een hoge berg veroverd te hebben... maar we worden er alleen tijdelijk gedoogd."
WHY: "Can only be visitors" → "worden er alleen tijdelijk gedoogd" (are only temporarily tolerated). "Gedoogd" is a powerful Dutch word — it implies permission can be revoked. Far stronger than "visitors".

### Three descriptive cues → one flowing sentence
EN: "Like the water running through it, / the ice itself is constantly moving, / flowing down the valley with unstoppable force."
NL: "De gletsjer beweegt zich als een niet te stuiten natuurkracht door de vallei."
WHY: 3 cues → 1. The comparison (like water) restructured: "niet te stuiten natuurkracht" (unstoppable natural force). Single flowing Dutch sentence captures the majesty.

### Mythical creature description condensed
EN: "The snow leopard is an almost mythical creature, / an icon of the wilderness, / an animal few humans have ever glimpsed / for its world is one we seldom visit."
NL: "De sneeuwluipaard is bijna een mythisch wezen. Een legende van de wildernis. / Omdat de mens hier bijna nooit komt, zien we er maar zelden een."
WHY: 4 cues → 2. "Icon" → "legende" (legend — even more mythical). "Few humans have ever glimpsed" → "zien we er maar zelden een" (we rarely see one — Dutch understatement).

### Hunter scene: tight action prose
EN: "On these treacherous slopes / no hunter other than the snow leopard / would have a chance of catching such fragile prey."
NL: "Alleen de sneeuwluipaard kan op zulke hellingen een prooi verschalken."
WHY: 3 cues → 1 (ratio 0.62). "Verschalken" (to snatch/catch by cunning) is a vivid Dutch hunting verb that replaces the verbose English construction.

### Scientific process made elegant
EN: "During its journey from the surface / the water absorbed carbon dioxide from the soil / making it mildly acidic."
NL: "Tijdens zijn reis neemt het CO2 op, waardoor het enigszins zuur wordt."
WHY: 3 cues → 1. "Carbon dioxide" → "CO2" (standard in Dutch science writing). The process described cleanly without the verbose "during its journey from the surface".

### Geological description restructured
EN: "Hydrogen sulphide gas bubbles up from oil deposits in the earth's crust. / It mixes with oxygen and the water, / and forms sulphuric acid."
NL: "Uit olieafzettingen in de aardkorst bubbelt waterstofsulfide omhoog. / Het reageert met de zuurstof in het water en vormt zwavelzuur."
WHY: V2 inversion: "Uit olieafzettingen... bubbelt... omhoog" (fronted location → verb second). "Mixes with" → "reageert met" (reacts with — more scientifically precise).

### Measurement conversion
EN: "these elephants walk up to 50 miles a day"
NL: "ze elke dag wel 80 km door droge rivierbeddingen lopen"
WHY: Miles → kilometers (standard for Dutch audience). "80 km" is the rounded metric equivalent.

### Desert heat condensed
EN: "kangaroos manage to get through the hottest part of the day / without heat stroke."
NL: "voorkomen de kangoeroes een zonnesteek."
WHY: 2 cues → 1 (ratio 0.50). "Manage to get through the hottest part of the day without" → "voorkomen" (prevent). Entire clause replaced by one verb.

## Extended Interview: Political Monologue
Source: The Fog of War (2003) — Robert McNamara interview documentary.

A single speaker reflecting at length on political/military decisions. The NL translator
condenses intellectual argumentation without losing the thread, and adapts colloquial
American political speech to natural Dutch.

### Rambling argument → tight thesis
EN: "Any military commander who is honest with himself... or with those he's speaking to will admit... that he has made mistakes in the application of military power."
NL: "Elke militaire commandant die eerlijk is... Zal erkennen dat hij fouten heeft gemaakt bij het uitoefenen van macht."
WHY: Three cues → two. "Or with those he's speaking to" is padding — "die eerlijk is" (who is honest) says it all. "In the application of military power" → "bij het uitoefenen van macht" — precise Dutch equivalent, no bloat.

### Repetitive emphasis → single statement
EN: "I was the first president in the history of the company... that had ever been president other than a member of the Ford family."
NL: "Ik was de eerste president-directeur die geen familielid was."
WHY: 127 → 60 chars (ratio 0.47). "In the history of the company" — obvious context, cut. "That had ever been... other than" → "die geen... was" — Dutch negative construction is shorter. "President" → "president-directeur" (correct Dutch corporate title).

### American idiom → Dutch equivalent in political context
EN: "Khrushchev's gotten himself in a hell of a fix."
NL: "Chroesjtsjov heeft zich in de puree gewerkt."
WHY: "Hell of a fix" → "in de puree" (in the porridge — Dutch idiom for deep trouble). "Khrushchev" → "Chroesjtsjov" (Dutch transliteration). The colloquial register of the original preserved.

### Military strategy condensed
EN: "I analyzed bombing operations, and how to make them more efficient. I.e., not more efficient in the sense of killing more... but more efficient in weakening the adversary."
NL: "Ik analyseerde de operaties om ze efficiënter te maken. Niet om meer mensen te doden, maar om de vijand te verzwakken."
WHY: Three cues → two. "I.e." meta-commentary dropped. The crucial distinction (efficiency ≠ more killing) kept intact. "Adversary" → "vijand" (enemy — more direct Dutch).

### Nuclear brinkmanship made concrete
EN: "LeMay believed that ultimately... we'd confront these people with nuclear weapons. And by God, we better do it when we have greater superiority... than we will have in the future."
NL: "LeMay geloofde dat we uiteindelijk kernwapens zouden inzetten. En dan maar beter nu meteen, nu we overwicht hadden, dan later."
WHY: Four cues → two. "Confront these people with" → "inzetten" (deploy — military verb, no euphemism). "By God, we better" → "dan maar beter" (well, better then — Dutch understatement replaces American bravado). "Greater superiority than we will have" → "nu we overwicht hadden, dan later" — shorter and clearer.

### Iconic quote kept powerful
EN: "LeMay said, 'If we'd lost the war... we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals.' And I think he's right."
NL: "LeMay zei: Als we hadden verloren... waren we vervolgd als oorlogsmisdadigers. Hij had gelijk."
WHY: Three cues → two. "I think he's right" → "Hij had gelijk" (He was right) — removes the hedge. Dutch directness makes the statement more powerful.

### Vulgar speech adapted cleanly
EN: "A lot of people think I'm a son of a bitch."
NL: "Veel mensen denken dat ik een schoft ben."
WHY: "Son of a bitch" → "schoft" — natural Dutch equivalent that carries the same weight without being a calque.

### Academic concept → colloquial Dutch
EN: "They wanted conspicuous consumption."
NL: "Ze wilden duur doen."
WHY: Veblen's economic term → "duur doen" (act expensive — colloquial Dutch). The audience doesn't need the academic reference; the meaning lands instantly.

### Emotional climax condensed
EN: "I don't wanna add anything to Vietnam. It is so complex that anything I say... will require additions and qualifications."
NL: "Ik zeg niets meer over Vietnam. Het is zo complex dat alles wat ik zeg verdere uitleg zal behoeven."
WHY: "Don't wanna add anything" → "Ik zeg niets meer" (I say nothing more — more final). "Additions and qualifications" → "verdere uitleg" (further explanation — simpler, same weight).

### Damned-if-you-do adapted
EN: "Is it the feeling that you're damned if you do... and if you don't, no matter what?" / "Yeah, that's right." / "And I would rather be damned if I don't."
NL: "Zo'n gevoel dat je verdoemd bent als je het doet en als je het niet doet?" / "Ja, inderdaad." / "Ik ben liever verdoemd als ik het niet doe."
WHY: "Damned" → "verdoemd" — Dutch has the direct equivalent. The three-beat exchange preserved. "No matter what" dropped — already implied by the damned-if construction.
